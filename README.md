# Rocket Movement 2D  

A 2D game simulation where players control a rocket and navigate it through space while managing its fuel and velocity.

## Overview  

Rocket Movement 2D is a simple simulation where players control the movement of a rocket using basic physics principles. The game involves controlling the rocket's thrust to maneuver through space while considering fuel consumption and velocity.

## Features  

- Control a rocket's movement in a 2D space environment.  
- Manage fuel consumption as the rocket moves.  
- Adjust rocket speed and trajectory using thrust.  
- Smooth physics-based movement and realistic acceleration.

## How to Install and Play  

To run the simulation locally:

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadishah-projects/Rocket-Movement-2D.git
   cd Rocket-Movement-2D
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   Make sure Python is installed on your machine, and then install Pygame:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the simulation:  
   Start the simulation by running:  
   ```bash
   python rocket_movement.py
   ```

## How to Play  

- **Objective**: Successfully navigate the rocket through space while managing fuel.  
- **Controls**:  
  - **Arrow Keys**: Move the rocket in the respective direction.  
  - **Spacebar**: Activate thrust to propel the rocket.  

## Built With  

- Python  
- Pygame  

## Future Improvements  

Some planned features for future updates:

- Add new levels with obstacles and gravity effects.  
- Implement a scoring system based on fuel efficiency and distance traveled.  
- Add background music and sound effects for rocket thrust and collisions.
